 Getting started with the tools like Prime Time, Design Compiler, yosys, iverilog, gtkview
 Below is the some detail and screenshot showing the successful launch of the above-mentioned tools:
Yosys:
 Yosys is an open-source framework for RTL (Register Transfer Level) synthesis and formal verification of digital circuits. Here are five key points about Yosys:
- Open-source framework for RTL synthesis and formal verification of digital circuits.
- Operates primarily on Verilog designs, converting them into gate-level netlists.
- Offers formal verification capabilities for equivalence checking between different circuit representations.
- Utilizes a script-driven synthesis flow, allowing customization and optimization.
- Supported by an active open-source community for continuous development and improvement.
